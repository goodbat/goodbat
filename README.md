- Goodbat here,
- I have been working in the IT field for quite some time. I started hanging tapes (yes, hanging tapes) on an IBM 360 in the 1970s and worked my way up to Unix system administrator, and Software Engineering Manager, and Network Director.
- After working in industry for quite some time, I became the Academic Director for the Information and Communications Technology program at the University of Denver, University College. During this time, I directed the creation of a bridge course for students new to programming. The course, Creative Problem Solving and Programming Concepts, helped students develop problem solving skills and learn programming fundamentals.
- I left the University of Denver in early 2022 to have fun and help people solve problems.

- In addition to helping people learn how to program, my current interests include Blockchain and Cybersecurity.
